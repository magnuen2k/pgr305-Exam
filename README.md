## Our project
We opted for the theme `Football players / football team` and made a website for the team Liverpool FC.

Both backend are frontend are built the way shown in class. A .NET/C# Web Api connected to MongoDB, and a frontend made in React with Typescript.


## Initialization:
In order to run this on your machine, you need both .NET and Node.js installed. 

#### Backend:
To run the backend, enter the /backend directory and enter the following command:
- `dotnet watch run`

Info of endpoints can be found through the Swagger interface, found on https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html.

#### Frontend:
To run the frontend, you need to first install the dependencies before you run it with the following commands below. Use either npm or yarn.
- `npm install` / `yarn install`
- `npm start` / `yarn start`

The website will then be availbile at http://localhost:3000/.
